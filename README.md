## Weather_Analysis-using-MapReduce
We will write a program that mines weather data. Weather sensors collect
data every hour at many locations across the globe and gather a large volume of log data,
which is a good candidate for analysis with MapReduce because we want to process all
the data, and the data is un-structured and record-oriented
